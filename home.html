                    <br>
                    Donating to charity is a major mood-booster. The knowledge that youâ€™re helping others is hugely
                    empowering and, in turn,
                    can make you feel happier and more fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a donation
                    to charity and
                    increased activity in the area of the brain that registers pleasure - proving that as the old adage
                    goes, it really is
                    far better to give than to receive.
    
                    Our own research into why people give supports this. We asked 700 of our generous donors to tell us what
                    motivates them
                    to give regularly to charity; 42% agreed the enjoyment they receive from giving as a key influence.

                <h3><span><b><u>GIVING TO CHARITY STRENGTHENS PERSONAL VALUES</u></b></span>
                    <br>
    
                    In our research, Why we give, a feeling of social conscience was the most widely-given reason to give to
                    charity.
                    Whatever type of charity work they supported, 96% said they felt they had a moral duty to use what they
                    had to help
                    others, a sentiment very much rooted in their personal values and principles.
    
                    Having the power to improve the lives of others is, to many people, a privilege, and one that comes with
                    its own sense
                    of obligation. Acting on these powerful feelings of responsibility is a great way to reinforce our own
                    personal values
                    and feel like weâ€™re living in a way that is true to our own ethical beliefs.

                    <br>
    
                    Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be reduced by tax or administrative costs,
                    preventing the
                    full amount from reaching the people or causes they really want to help. Thankfully there are ways to
                    make the most of
                    every donation to charity.
    
                    If youâ€™re a UK taxpayer, you can boost the amount of every donation you make by giving through Gift Aid,
                    an Income Tax
                    relief created to help charities get the most out of the funds they receive. As Gift Aid enables the
                    charity to recover
                    the basic rate of tax on your donation, the scheme adds 25p to each Â£1 you give at no extra cost to you.
    
                    There are many other ways to give to charity tax-effectively too, such as by donating straight from your
                    salary before
                    tax is deducted through a payroll giving scheme, donating shares to charity or leaving a charitable
                    legacy in your Will.
                    These methods of giving ensure your chosen charities benefit as much as possible from your support.

                <h3><span><b><u>GIVING TO CHARITY INTRODUCES YOUR CHILDREN TO THE IMPORTANCE OF GENEROSITY</u></b></span>
                    <br>
        
                Sharing the experience of donating to charity with your children shows them from a young age that they can make positive
                changes in the world. Children naturally love to help others, so nurturing their innate generosity is likely to mean
                that they grow up with a greater appreciation of what they have, and will carry on supporting charity in years to come.
                
                Starting a tradition of donating to charity with your children is easy - try creating a family donation box that
                everyone can add to and nominate a family charity each year, involving the children in choosing which causes to support.
